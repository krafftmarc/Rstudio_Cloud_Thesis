#Easiest way to check, a Shapiro test 
shapiro.test(data$nsc) 
#??shapiro.test
#assess whether a sample of data comes from a normally distributed population. 
#based on the comparison between the observed sample data and the expected values under the assumption of a normal distribution.
#Null Hypothesis (H0): The null hypothesis of the test is that the data follows a normal distribution.
#Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): The alternative hypothesis is that the data does not follow a normal distribution.

#Test Statistic (W): The test statistic (W) is calculated from the ordered sample values. 
#Is a measure of how closely the sample distribution resembles a normal distribution. 
#The closer W is to 1, the more likely the data is normally distributed.
#The p-value associated with the test statistic is used to determine the significance of the result. 
#If the p-value is less than the significance level (commonly 0.05), null hypothesis is rejected, 
#indicating that the data is significantly different from a normal distribution.

correlation <- cor(data$nsc, data$treatment_n)
print(correlation)

# Perform linear regression analysis
model <- lm(data$nsc ~ data$treatment_n)
summary(model)


#### Model broken down
# Coefficients:
# The coefficients section presents the estimates for the intercept and the coefficient associated with the data$treatment_n 
# variable. These estimates represent the expected change in the dependent variable for each unit increase in the independent 
# variable.

# The estimate for the intercept is 79.3939, suggesting that when data$treatment_n (irrigation) is zero, the expected value 
# of NSCs is ~79.3939. The p-value associated with this (Intercept) is the probability of observing
# that value for the intercept coefficient, assuming the null hypothesis that the true value of the 
# coefficient is zero. WHICH IS NOT THE CASE FOR OUR TREATMENTS, a small p-value suggests strong evidence against the null 
# hypothesis. Therefore, in this case, the small p-value for the intercept indicates that the intercept coefficient 
# is statistically significant, meaning that the y-intercept is significantly different from zero.

# The estimate for data$treatment_n is 0.5776, indicating that for each unit increase in data$treatment_n, the 
# expected change in data$nsc is 0.5019. However, the associated p-value for this coefficient is 0.758 
# which is not statistically significant. Predictions might improve the more data we have

# Residual standard error:
# The residual standard error (RSE) is an estimate of the standard deviation of the residuals. In this case, the 
# RSE is 22.32, indicating the average amount by which the observed data$nsc values deviate from the predicted values
# is 22.32! A LOT!

# Multiple R-squared and Adjusted R-squared:
# The multiple R-squared value represents the proportion of variability in the dependent variable that can be explained 
# by the independent variable(s). In this case, the R-squared value is 0.0006702 suggesting that the data$treatment_n 
# variable explains a very small fraction of the variability in data$nsc. The adjusted R-squared value takes into account 
# the number of predictors in the model, and in this case, it is slightly negative (-0.006367), suggesting that the model does 
# not improve the prediction of data$nsc compared to a simple mean.

# F-statistic and p-value:
# The F-statistic assesses the overall significance of the model by comparing the variability explained by the model to 
# the unexplained variability. In this example, the F-statistic is 0.09523, with a corresponding p-value of 0.7581, indicating 
# that the model is not statistically significant in explaining the variability in data$nsc.
# that treatment have no significant effect on the NSCs levels


## THEREFORE, FOR THIS PARTICULAR HEATWAVE, IT IS NOT RELEVANT TO MAKE PREDICTIONS BASED ON WATER ##
# Let's do it just for the fun
# NSCs predictions with variable water treatments
# New data for prediction
data$treatment_one = data$treatment_n-1
data$treatment_one = data$treatment_n-1.5

# Make predictions

# Print the predictions
print(predictions)

# Obtain predictions with confidence intervals
pred_interval <- predict(model, data = data$treatment_one, interval = "confidence")
# Print the predictions with confidence intervals
print(pred_interval)

                                    ### Starch ###

# Calculate the correlation coefficient
correlation2 <- cor(data$starch, data$treatment_n)
print(correlation2) # a negative correlation

# Perform linear regression analysis

summary(model2)

# Make predictions
predictions <- predict(model2, data = data2$treatment_one)
# Print the predictions
print(predictions)

# Obtain predictions with confidence intervals
pred_interval2 <- predict(model2, data = data2$treatment_one, interval = "confidence")
# Print the predictions with confidence intervals
print(pred_interval2)

#### Approach #2
lm_result <- lm(nsc ~ treatment_n, data = data)
# View the regression model summary
summary(lm_result)

# Create a new treatment_n variable with the desired values
new_treatment <- c(0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6)

# Predict nsc for the new treatment values
predicted_nsc <- predict(lm_result, newdata = data.frame(treatment_n = new_treatment))

# View the predicted nsc values
predicted_nsc
## Again, this won't be a great help, because the amount of water seem to have very little effect on the NSCs or Starch levels

#BUT!
### If is not water, then what is it? Random Forest model for variable importance and predictions----

#Splitting data into training and test sets 
set.seed(666)  # Set a seed for reproducibility
train_indices <- createDataPartition(data$nsc, times = 1, p = 0.7, list = FALSE) #70% of the data
train_data <- data[train_indices, ]
test_data <- data[-train_indices, ]

# Random Forest model for nsc
model_nsc <- randomForest(nsc ~ ., data = train_data, ntree = 5000, importance = TRUE)

# Random Forest model for starch
model_starch <- randomForest(starch ~ ., data = train_data, ntree = 5000, importance = TRUE)
#(ntree) is the number of trees in the forest

#### Predict on test data
nsc_pred <- predict(model_nsc, newdata = test_data)
starch_pred <- predict(model_starch, newdata = test_data)

# Assess model performance
nsc_rmse <- sqrt(mean((nsc_pred - test_data$nsc)^2))
starch_rmse <- sqrt(mean((starch_pred - test_data$starch)^2))

# Print RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) for each model, average difference between actual 
# values and predicted values. The lower, the better. 
print(paste("RMSE for nsc:", nsc_rmse)) # BAAAAAAAAAD
print(paste("RMSE for starch:", starch_rmse)) # NOT AS BAD

# Variable importance for nsc
varimp_nsc <- importance(model_nsc)
# print(varimp_nsc) not ordered results
varimp_nsc_ordered <- varimp_nsc[order(varimp_nsc[, 1]), ] # %IncMSE is ordered from smallest to largest
print(varimp_nsc_ordered)

# Variable importance for "starch"
varimp_starch <- importance(model_starch)
#print(varimp_starch)
varimp_starch_ordered <- varimp_starch[order(varimp_starch[, 1]), ] # %IncMSE is ordered from smallest to largest
print(varimp_starch_ordered)

##### Output of the models:
# "%IncMSE" (percentage increase in mean squared error) & 
# "IncNodePurity" (increase in node purity).
''' 
"%IncMSE": This metric measures the increase in mean squared error when a variable is 
randomly permuted or removed from the model. Higher values indicate greater importance of the 
variable in predicting the target variable (nscs). For example, variables like "sugar_perc" 
and "leafwp" have high "%IncMSE" values, suggesting they have a significant impact on 
predicting "nsc". THE HIGHER, THE MORE IMPORTANT ON PREDICTED VARIABLE

"IncNodePurity": This metric measures the increase in node purity (impurity reduction) 
associated with a variable. Variables with higher values contribute more to the overall 
purity of the nodes in the decision trees. In this case, variables like "VPcham" and "SVPleaf" 
have high "IncNodePurity" values, indicating their importance in predicting "nsc".

From the results, the variables displaying  anegative sign, negatively contribute to the 
accuracy of the forest models, and therefore we can remove them:

Which seems interesting, because this indicates that there is a possibility to predict the value of NSCs based on 
some variables in the Li-Cor readings (VPcham), gtw, SVPlead, Emm

The more data we feed into the model predictor, the more accurate wil be on which variables to pay attention to. 
With some exceptions, like sugar %, which is just a variable created from the NSC values itself. Which explains its 
high numbers on the predictions. 
Does it make any sense based on what the other variables are?
(VPcham) Vapor pressure in the chamber
(gtw) total conductance to water vapor
(SVPleaf) Saturation vapor pressure at leaf temp
(Emm) Transpiration Rate
(TleafEB) 
However, we have to keep in mind that these importance scores do not provide information about the direction or nature of the relationship. 
They only indicate the importance of each variable in terms of predictive accuracy. 
Further analysis: Maybe examining partial dependence plots (pdp) or variable interactions could provide more insights into how these 
variables influence the NSCs values.
Also, when interpreting variable importance, it is crucial to consider potential collinearity.

    scale_color_manual(values = c("2L" = "light green", "4L" = "light blue")) +

})

# Arrange the plots in a grid
multiplot <- do.call(gridExtra::grid.arrange, plots)

# Display the multiplot
multiplot
# Each individual plot can be accesed through indexes 
# for example plot_variable3 <- multiplot[["variable3"]]
starch_plot <- multiplot[[2]]

# Now you can use the starch_plot as needed
print(starch_plot)


hist(data$nsc + data$starch)
