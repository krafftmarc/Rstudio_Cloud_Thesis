Notes on the Li-Cor data:

-Each row is the average of 3 readings per vine. We gathered data for each vine in 3 different leaves.

-For both xlsx files the only "relevant" sheets are: 
	
		Block A & Block B

-EJF 1 & EJF2 sheets are just the referenced original files from each console, the data in these sheets 
is not organized nor clean

- "Remarks" sheets are only used for references in the console, can be ignored

- Data collection was performed with different designs in each heatwave:
@ 1st event was randomized data gathering. Meaning that we sampled different vines in every time slot 

@ 2nd event we selected 9 vines in each block and we took the Li-Cor readings at the same vines
in every time slot

We ran into unexpected issues with one of the consoles on the 7AM reading @2nd event. Therefore, we have no
data recorded for: Block B-7AM. This pushed our next reading quite a bit (e.g., 10 AM readings were collected
at ~11AM). This was corrected later in the day when we got some folks to help us sample.
